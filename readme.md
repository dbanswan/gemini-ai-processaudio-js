# Process Audio Files With Gemini Api In Javascript

A simple example of using gemini-1.5-pro-latest model to process audio files in javascript.

**We take the famous audio of Neil Armstrong's "Small Step" and ask Gemini to describe what's happening in the audio.**

Here is a sample output:

```
‚ùØ node app.js
The audio describes the iconic moment of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission. His famous quote, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," marks a pivotal moment in human history and space exploration.

```

Without even giving any hint of what's in the audio, it describes the audio pretty accurately.

## Steps to run this project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Rename .env_local to .env
3. In .env file Replace `AIzaSyD502555-555-5555-5555-555555555555` with your own API key which you can get from [Google Cloud Console](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
5. Run `node app.js` to run the script.

Experiment with different audio files and see what Gemini can do. Have fun!
